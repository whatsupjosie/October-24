# Acceptance matrix — Control Room + 2.5D Television Studio
**Date:** 2026-10-31 · **Revision:** 1 · **State:** UNSEALED

This is not a list of aspirations. A row is complete only with:
- executable command and observed exit status;
- dated log/test artifact or screenshot/recording and where it can be read;
- source commit SHA;
- negative-path checks for a consequential control;
- explicit owner verification if a gate depends on owner aesthetics or hardware.

Use: `NOT STARTED`, `CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED`,
`FAIL WITH REPRO`, `VERIFIED IN EXECUTED ENVIRONMENT`,
`OWNER APPROVED`. Never use “green” for source inspection alone.

| ID | Acceptance gate / exact observation | Starting status 10/31 | Next proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| G00 | Environment: bootstrap pinned requirements, launch main.py, no hidden dependency downloads, explicit startup log | NOT STARTED | real install and health |
| G01 | Authentication and operator roles: director/mod/guest enforced on camera/audio/recording and media | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | real HTTP positive/negative permissions |
| G02 | 2.5D page opens on phone and laptop without script errors | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | browser console/network inspection |
| G03 | Eight unique stage genre packages load with distinct usable sets and real camera angles | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | screenshots/video of each real scene |
| G04 | GLB avatar actual walk/gesture/animation, reliable repeated teardown, depth/occlusion, 2.5D blocking | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | multi-genre browser run |
| G05 | Shared one Program/Preview CameraManager used by TV and walkable studio, true atomic CUT and dissolve | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | two simultaneous real clients + server state |
| G06 | Director displays actual remote camera frames with freshness/staleness and no invented LIVE imagery | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | real frame transport acceptance |
| G07 | Production-grade broadcast-rate video ingest and multiple independent camera feeds beyond JPEG confidence | NOT STARTED | media stream transport + replay/record |
| G08 | Shared authoritative program-audio mixer plus real cross-client media and solo/mute/gain | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | synchronized recorded audio |
| G09 | Audio/video switching keyboard controls do not operate live stage while editor is focused | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | browser keyboard regression |
| G10 | Director stations: teleprompter, VTR, camera rig, graphic/chyron, recording, joystick and stable operator actions | PARTLY CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | station-by-station accepted test |
| G11 | Real recording button starts capture and indicates success only upon file writing | PARTLY CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | inspect created media |
| G12 | PANIC stops active captures, silences actual audio, cues black output, logs partial failure | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | trigger during active session |
| G13 | Production persists after stop/restart and media is playable, accessible in project browser | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | reopen after process/browser restart |
| G14 | Blackbox receives actual audio/video/performance/telemetry/manifest, not just markers | NOT STARTED | recorded manifest with checksums |
| G15 | Separate 15-second clacker reference: video red dash, dedicated blip audio, same timeline across sources | PARTLY CORE CODE / RECORDING UNVERIFIED | timestamp measurement and playback |
| G16 | Per-track +0.030s offset persists across reload; 24/25/30 fps EDL and exact sidecar map correctly | ISOLATED V8 TESTS ONLY | actual editor and Resolve import |
| G17 | Basic shoot editor: media bin, viewer, rough selects, split, lift, ripple, close gaps, save/reopen | CODE PRESENT / RUNTIME UNVERIFIED | real browser smoke |
| G18 | Proxy footage and authoritative replayable master separate, camera coverage preserved for later editorial decision | NOT STARTED | full independent source bundle |
| G19 | Deterministic source-level scene replay: performer, camera, lights, graphics, media and dependencies | NOT STARTED | re-render same frame twice after restart |
| G20 | Render only chosen camera/time ranges at genuine native 4K high fidelity (not upscaled proxy) | NOT STARTED | inspect frames and native resolution |
| G21 | Professional media package: separate audio, usable image/video masters, manifests/hashes, nonproprietary relinking on different computer | NOT STARTED | round trip to independent machine |
| G22 | DaVinci Resolve Free takes a supported cut/footage path; source masters unmodified and editor metadata portable | CODE PRESENT / IMPORT UNVERIFIED | actual Resolve cut/relink |
| G23 | All significant shortcut audits/repros corrected, three debug rounds and performance profile on modest device | NOT STARTED | dated performance/test artifacts |
| G24 | Walkable Bella Faux Pas experience not regressed by 2.5D/Control Room work | USER SAW HISTORICAL DEMO; CURRENT BRANCH UNVERIFIED | smoke test old and new |
| G25 | No owner input except specific visuals, artistic decisions, credentials and live hardware genuinely needed | ACCEPTANCE POLICY | record owner-only issues |
| G26 | Final owner acceptance and explicit seal approval | NOT REQUESTED | owner review after G00–G25 |

## Practical test commands to attempt, not to claim already run
```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q tests/test_shared_studio_switchers.py tests/test_studio25d_media_routes.py tests/test_studio25d_recording_guard.py
node --test tests/test_production25d_core.cjs tests/test_production25d_wiring.cjs tests/test_production25d_switcher_bridge.cjs tests/test_studio25d_confidence.cjs tests/test_editor_sync_interchange.cjs
python main.py
```
Adjust only after inspecting the actual repo's commands/dependencies and
security setup; never run destructive install or network access silently.

## Previous evidence (scoped)
The October 30 branch reported isolated V8 module/DOM checks, 12/12
isolated mocked studio behavior checks, 12/12 isolated editor logic tests,
and a synthetic editor UI run. The Python pytest, actual browser camera
transmission, cross-client audio, full recording and Resolve import were
**not** verified. CI failed before showing usable job steps/logs; no
executed CI result is available. Those scoped observations are historical,
not pass marks for this matrix.

## Defect priority
P0: data loss/security/media falsely marked saved; source-master corruption.
P1: unusable camera/audio control, incorrect routing, authentication failure,
    capture/stop/panic failure, cross-client desync, startup failure.
P2: broken genre shot/animations/UI or editor handoff.
P3: final surface/art and minor cosmetics.
Fix highest-priority reproducible issues first while preserving all work.
